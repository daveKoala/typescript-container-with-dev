## Set up

There are a few options to set up and run.

The best way is to develop within a self contained Docker Container. This will install required dependencies including versions of Node.js and NPM

**_You will need [Docker Desktop] installed and running_**

```
cd ./app
make up
```

The api docs can be found at: [api docs]

## Makefile

`make help`
